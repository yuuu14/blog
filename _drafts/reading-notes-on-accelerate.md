Discusses how to measure performance of software team. Given three examples: lines of code, velocity, and ultilization. The last criterion is not clear to me, mentioned "queue theory": ultilization -> 100%, lead times -> infinity.

Focused on global level instead of individuals, outcomes instead of output.

List four metrics for measurement.

Delivery lead time, from the beginning of a request by the customer to it being satified. (What is *Lean Theory*) Contains two part: product/feature designing and delivering. Delivery lead time is easier to quantify (code committed to code successfully running in production), better be shorter, getting faster feedback, enabling quick fix of error/outage.

Batch size (of which deployment frequency is the reciprocal) (What is Batch Size in software development?) 

Stability/Reliability. How quickly can service be restored? 

What percentage of changes to production fail. (Change Fail Percentage).
