write some formula:  
$\mathbb{P}(c|x) = \frac{\mathbb{P}(x|c) \times \mathbb{P}(c)}{\sum_{i}^{N}\mathbb{P}(x|c)}$


I am taking one seminar this sememster, *Hybrid Learning*. The topic I was assigned with is about models
combining deep learning and reasoning, called *Rational Neural Machines* as the same name of this paper.
This post contains some of my thoughts after reading it.
