I use Windows and Linux both frequently, but I get used to the commands of latter. My current internship is supposed to develop
projects on Windows and it can be a bit frustrating getting errors when I tried to use Linux command directly on cmd. 
Since I have to check the equivalent command for Windows online, it is useful to keep some notes in case I just forget it next day.
Each command I will list few common parameters.

| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| win | linux | res |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| dir /a /b  | ls -a -l -sh | get dir list |
| cd /d | cd | change dir 
| start | xdg-open | open file with designated application |
| - | wc -l | word count --line |
| - | mkdir -p | create dir recursively
