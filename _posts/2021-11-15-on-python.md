## Buffering
Buffering: FIFO queue in memory, not write to disk until it is full.  

`flush()`: write data on buffer to disk


## Threading
use threading while display `tqdm` bar:  
[how to use tqdm with multithreading?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63826035/how-to-use-tqdm-with-multithreading)
```py
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor, as_completed
from tqdm import tqdm

def task(param):
    # do something
    return param

params = ['test1', 'test2']
with tqdm(total=len(urls)) as pbar:
    with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=10) as ex:
        futures = [ex.submit(task, param) for param in params]
        for future in as_completed(futures):
            result = future.result()
            pbar.update(1)
```

## for/else
[`for/else`](https://book.pythontips.com/en/latest/for_-_else.html)
```py
for item in container:
    if search_something(item):
        # Found it!
        process(item)
        break
else:
    # Didn't find anything..
    not_found_in_container()
```

## naming with underscore(s)
> `_single_leading_underscore`: weak “internal use” indicator. E.g. from M import * does not import objects whose name starts with an underscore.
> `single_trailing_underscore_`: used by convention to avoid conflicts with Python keyword, e.g.:
>> Tkinter.Toplevel(master, class_='ClassName')
> `_\_double\_leading\_underscore`: when naming a class attribute, invokes name mangling (inside class FooBar, __boo becomes _FooBar__boo; see below).
> `__double_leading_and_trailing_underscore__`: “magic” objects or attributes that live in user-controlled namespaces. E.g. __init__, __import__ or __file__. Never invent such names; only use them as documented.
